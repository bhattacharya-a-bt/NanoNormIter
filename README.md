# NanoNormIter
Pre-processing of NanoString normalization data, as described in "An approach for normalization and quality control for NanoString RNA expression data" (Bhattacharya and Hamilton et al, 2020)

Note: this package includes functions used for pre-processing procedure outlined [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.032490v2). This is not a novel method, but provides an iterative framework for quality control and normalization of NanoString nCounter expression data. A tutorial is provided [here](https://github.com/bhattacharya-a-bt/CBCS_normalization/blob/master/CBCS_normalization_tutorial.pdf).
